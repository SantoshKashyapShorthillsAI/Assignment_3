"Challenges & Changes Needed
 Program on this scale never conceived
 Each Pillar/program has own challenges
 Human Resource Issues
 NIC - not equipped for a fraction of this task (obsolesce) - needs revamping & restructuring
 DeitY – needs program managers – at least 4 more officers at senior levels
 Ministries – Need a Chief Information Officer / Chief Technology Officer (CIO/CTO)
 Could begin with CIOs 10 major Ministries
 Can be anyone – from within or outside government
 To be patterned as AS & FAs – dual reporting
 Financial Resource Issues
 Mostly structured around ongoing programs : Better focus, need some restructuring
 Some others are process improvements or better utilisation of resources
 A few new programs may be needed – particularly in Electronics manufacturing and Skill Development
 Coordination Issues
 Program covers many other departments
 Need commitment and effort
 Leadership and support critical for success"
